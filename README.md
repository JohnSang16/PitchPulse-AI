## 💡 Project Motivation
PitchPulse AI was born from a desire to solve a specific, high-stakes problem: the "information overload" faced by modern soccer coaches during live match-play. While professional teams have access to massive amounts of data, the ability to translate that data into real-time, actionable tactical shifts remains a significant bottleneck.

As a Computer Science student and a lifelong soccer enthusiast, I recognized that <strong>stochastic modeling and AI</strong> could bridge this gap. I targeted the coaching workflow specifically because it requires a unique blend of analytical precision and human intuition.

On a technical level, this project allowed me to move beyond basic CRUD applications and explore the intersection of <strong>predictive mathematics and scalable systems</strong>. By implementing Monte Carlo simulations in a Flask environment and delivering them through an optimized React interface, I’ve created a tool that doesn't just display stats—it predicts outcomes and offers strategic counsel. This is a reflection of my commitment to using technology to solve complex, niche problems in industries I am passionate about.
